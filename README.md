In this JAVA program we have calculated ' Simple Interest ' by two methods :
1. By assigning values directly to the variables and applying arithmetic operators (*,/).
2. By takng input from user and applying same process of arithmetic operators .

In this JAVA program we check whether the number is divisible by '5' or '11'.
By taking input from user and applying if-else conditional statement we can check whether the number is divisible by '5' or '11'.
